# onedrobe-website

Collaboration website for a CA115 module assignment in DCU in April 2023.

The goal was to create a website to advertise and explain a fictional product. ONEDROBE is a fictional browser extension that keeps track of users' clothing sizes and makes suggestions when the user is shopping to fill in the correct measurements.
